Jackson Annotation Example for WildFly
==========================================

WildFly adds implicitly to each new deployment, which uses JAX-RS annotations, the JAX-RS subsystem that includes Jackson dependencies (see [here][WFLY-23]).
The version of the implicitly added Jackson dependencies do not match with the version of the Jackson dependency,
which is used by Camunda Spin. This leads to problems with the usage of variable serialization and the usage of Jackson annotations (like `@JsonIgnore` for example).

This example demonstrates how to configure the own application together with WildFly to use Jackson annotations
and json serialization.

# Overview

## How to run it

1. Checkout the git repository
2. Build the project with maven
3. Deploy the created war on WildFly
4. Open Cockpit and take a look into the process 'waitingProcess'
5. Look at the variable called `variable`, only the properties `property1` and `property3` are shown.

## How it works

The important part is the `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` with the following content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jboss-deployment-structure>
  <deployment>
    <exclude-subsystems>
      <!-- exclude jaxrs subsystem, which are added implicit by WildFly -->
      <subsystem name="jaxrs"/>
    </exclude-subsystems>
    <dependencies>
      <!-- Add jackson dependencies with the version which is used by spin. -->
      <module name="com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-annotations" slot="${version}" export="true"/>
      <module name="com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-core" slot="${version}" export="true"/>
      <module name="com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-databind" slot="${version}" export="true"/>
      <!-- Add other modules, which are needed by your application and part of the jaxrs subsystem -->
    </dependencies>
  </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

It excludes the JAX-RS subsystem and adds the Jackson dependencies with the correct version.
These version corresponds to the version which is used by Camunda Spin for de-/serialization.
