The [`index.js`](./index.js) file of this directory should be clear enough to give you an idea of how to implement the SDK in your node.js applications.

2. Set a name for your deployment (`weodihx7` is __OK__)
3. Answer a few things
4. When asked "In which directory the files to be deployed?", press "enter"   
   (or give the full path to a directory containing BPMN files)
5. Select "Working.bpmn" (if you pressed "enter" at previous step)
