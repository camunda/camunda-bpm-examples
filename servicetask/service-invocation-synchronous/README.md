# Synchronous Service Invocation

This quickstart demonstrates how to implement a synchronous service invocation using a Java Delegate.
We learn

* How to implement the Java Delegate Interface,
* How to reference a Java Delegate Implementation from BPMN 2.0

After having looked through the code, you will understand the behavior of a synchronous service invocation in case of

* Successful invocation
* An invocation failure.

## Show me the important parts!

The process model is composed of three tasks:

![Process Model][1]

* Wait State Before: initially the process instance is waiting here
* Synchronous Service Task: the service task invoked by the process engine in a synchronous fashion
* Wait State After: in case of successful invocation, the process instance will advance to here

### Create a Java Delegate Implementation

Implement the `org.camunda.bpm.engine.delegate.JavaDelegate` interface:

``` java
public class SynchronousServiceTask implements JavaDelegate {

  // some constants provided to the unit test

  public static final String SHOULD_FAIL_VAR_NAME = "shouldFail";
  public static final String PRICE_VAR_NAME = "price";
  public static final float PRICE = 199.00f;

  public void execute(DelegateExecution execution) {

    // Here you could either add the business logic of the service task
    // or delegate to the actual business logic implementation provided
    // by a different class.

    // You could also invoke a Remote Service using REST, SOAP or EJB-Remote
    // in a synchronous fashion.

    // In this example, we
    //  - either throw an exception
    //  - or add a variable to the execution so that we can check for it in the unit test:

    boolean shouldFailVarName = ((Boolean) execution.getVariable(SHOULD_FAIL_VAR_NAME));
    if (shouldFailVarName) {
      throw new RuntimeException("Service invocation failure!");

    } else {
      execution.setVariable(PRICE_VAR_NAME, PRICE);

    }

  }

}
```

### Reference the JavaDelegate from BPMN 2.0

The Java Deleagte can be referenced using the `class` attribute from the process engine Namespace:

``` xml
<bpmn2:serviceTask id="ServiceTask_1"
  camunda:class="org.camunda.quickstart.servicetask.invocation.sync.SynchronousServiceTask"
  name="Synchronous Service Task">
```

Using the camunda Modeler, you can configure the service task using the properties panel:

![Configure Java Delegate using the camunda Modeler][2]


## How does it work?

If you are impatient, just have a look at the [unit test][4].

By default, the process engine uses the client thread to do work. In this example, the unit test
triggers the process engine using the `completeTask()` method. The process engine uses that very thread to
advance execution from the user task to the service task and invoke the `execute()` method provided by the
`Java Delegate` implementation:

![Synchronous Service Invocation Sequence][3]

This blocks the process engine from advancing in the process
instance until the call returns.

The synchronous nature of the invocation allows leveraging of the Thread Context:
the `JavaDelegate` implementation may participate in the same transaction
as the process engine, Security Context is propagated and so on.

The synchronous nature of the invocation also allows very simple failure
handling strategy: if this delegate implementation throws an exception, it will be
caught by the blocked thread and handled using a transaction rollback: the process
engine will roll back to the last persistent state. In this example the last persistent
state is the usertask preceding the service task ("Wait State Before").

## How to use it?

1. Checkout the project with Git
2. Import the project into your IDE
3. Inspect the sources and run the unit test.
