Basic authentication against embedded engine example
======================================================

This example is not actively maintained anymore. You can refer to the [example with fixed version of Camunda 7.18](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/blob/7.18/cockpit/cockpit-angularjs-search-processes).
Due to Camunda Platform 7 backward compatibility, the examples usually still work with later versions. However, you
might need to adjust them to make them work.
