Angular "Open Usertasks" Cockpit Tab
=======================================

This example is not actively maintained anymore. You can refer to the example with fixed version of Camunda 7.19:
[README](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/blob/7.19/cockpit/cockpit-angular-open-usertasks/README.md).
Due to Camunda Platform 7 backward compatibility, the examples usually still work with later versions. However, you
might need to adjust them to make them work.
