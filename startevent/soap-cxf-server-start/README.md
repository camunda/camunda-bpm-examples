SOAP CXF server start process example 
===============================================================
This example demonstrates how to start a process via a SOAP webservice-server generated using CXF in a Spring application. This example works with Tomcat distribution. The example is tested with Java 8.

![Example Process][png]

The example BPMN 2.0 process is triggered by a SOAP call. The SOAP webservice-server starts the process by submitting a start form.

# Overview

- [BPMN source code][bpmn]
- [WSDL][wsdl] / [XSD][xsd] webservice definition
- Spring context 
  - [BankAccountService][bankAccountService] and [BankService][bankService] services
  - [beans.xml][beans] and [engine.xml][engine]
- [JUnit tests][unit tests]

# How it works
The webservice bindings are generated using the maven plugin `cxf-codegen-plugin`. The Camunda engine is configured via Spring.

The webservice context is loaded from [beans.xml][beans], including two services:
 * `BankAccountService` - SOAP endpoint server.
 * `BankService` - spring service, performing some logging. i.e. dummy service.
 
The `BankAccountService` endpoint is secured in two ways
 * [Basic Authentication][basicauth]
 * SOAP header containing secret value
 
The BPMN 2.0 process is started with two variables: 
 * `accountNumber` - account number targeted by the operation
 * `accountName` - name which is to be set on the account

A custom [validator] makes sure the `accountNumber` value consists only of digits.

The SOAP request consists of a `SetAccountNameRequest` body and `BankRequestHeader` header. It starts the process using `FormService.submitStartForm(..)`.

As the process service task executes, it invokes `setAccountName(..)` on the `BankService` Spring service, performing a logging statement.

## Form-validation exception handling via SOAP Faults
The `BankAccountService` service translates start node form-validation exceptions to SOAP faults. The SOAP fault contains information on which field failed to validate. 

# How to use it?

1. Checkout the project with Git
2. Read and run the [JUnit tests][unit tests]
3. Build with maven and deploy .war file on tomcat.
4. Access the [WDSL][wsdl-localhost] using credentials 'user'/'password' used for example SoapUI.
