SOAP CXF server start process example 
===============================================================

This example is not actively maintained anymore. You can refer to the [example with fixed version of Camunda 7.18](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/blob/7.18/startevent/soap-cxf-server-start).
Due to Camunda Platform 7 backward compatibility, the examples usually still work with later versions. However, you
might need to adjust them to make them work.
