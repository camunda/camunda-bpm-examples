# Tweet directly from the Tasklist - Spring Boot packaged

This example demonstrates how you can use a BPMN process and the Tweeter API to build a simple Twitter client. 
It uses `camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter-webapp` and thus embed Tomcat as a web container.

The example contains:
- a process application with one process deployed on the Camunda engine
- custom forms to create and review the Tweet
- creates on startup an admin user "demo" (password: demo)

It also demonstrates the usage of the `application.yaml` configuration file.

## How is it done

1. To embed the Camunda Engine you must add following dependency to your `pom.xml`:
   
```xml
...
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.springboot</groupId>
 <artifactId>camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter-webapp</artifactId>
 <version>7.18.0</version>
</dependency>
...
```

2. With Spring Boot you usually create an "application" class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`. In order to have a Camunda process application
registered, you can simply add the annotation `@EnableProcessApplication` to the same class and also include the `processes.xml` file in your `META-INF` folder:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableProcessApplication
public class TwitterServletProcessApplication {

  public static void main(String... args) {
    SpringApplication.run(TwitterServletProcessApplication.class, args);
  }
}
```

3. You can also put BPMN, CMMN and DMN files in your classpath, they will be automatically deployed and registered within the process application.

4. You can configure your Spring Boot application using `application.yaml` file. All possible Camunda-specific configuration parameters are listed [here](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.18/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/configuration/)

5. This example provides two implementations for posting a Tweet:
* `TweetContentOfflineDelegate` (default) - will just print the tweet content on console
* `TweetContentDelegate` - can post a tweet when providing credentials for your twitter account

You can switch between two implementations by changing the name of a Spring bean to `tweetAdapter`. This `tweetAdapter` bean is further referenced in 
the BPMN diagram via "Delegate expression" in a service task:

```xml
...
<serviceTask id="service_task_publish_on_twitter" name="Publish on Twitter" camunda:delegateExpression="#{tweetAdapter}">
  ...
</serviceTask>
...
```

## Run the application and check the result

You can build the application by `mvn clean install` and then run it with `java -jar` command.

Go to `http://localhost:8080` (provide login/password from `application.yaml`, default: demo/demo) then go to Tasklist and try to start the process and complete the tasks, observe log entries or the real tweet when `TweetContentDelegate` is used.
