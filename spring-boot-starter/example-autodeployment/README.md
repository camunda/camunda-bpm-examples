# Spring Boot application with embedded Camunda engine and auto-deployed process

This example is not actively maintained anymore. You can refer to the [example with fixed version of Camunda 7.18](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/blob/7.18/spring-boot-starter/example-autodeployment).
Due to Camunda Platform 7 backward compatibility, the examples usually still work with later versions. However, you
might need to adjust them to make them work.

Or have a look at another Spring Boot Starter example: [spring-boot-starter/example-simple](/spring-boot-starter/example-simple).
