# Spring Servlet Process Application (using embedded Tomcat 7)

This example demonstrates how to deploy a spring powered web application which

  * Includes a `@ProcessApplication` class and some BPMN 2.0 processes
  * Starts a Spring Web application context based on a shared, container managed process engine
  * Uses Spring Beans and delegation code in expressions within processes

## Why is this example interesting?

This example shows how to combine a `@ProcessApplication class`, a `processes.xml` and a spring applicationContext into 
a fully-fledged process application with all its advantages, including a shared, container managed process engine paired 
with the power of Spring Beans inside your processes.

## Show me the important parts!

A process application class was created which extends the `ServletProcessApplication` class. The class was annotated 
with `@ProcessApplication`. This allows the Camunda BPM Platform to pick it up and register the process application 
without any further action:

```java
@ProcessApplication
public class SpringServletProcessApplication extends ServletProcessApplication {
  ...
}
```

Through the `META-INF/processes.xml`, we can define process archives and additional options, like creating new engines 
when deploying the process application:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<process-application
  xmlns="http://www.camunda.org/schema/1.0/ProcessApplication"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.camunda.org/schema/1.0/ProcessApplication http://www.camunda.org/schema/1.0/ProcessApplication">

  <process-archive>
  <properties>
    <property name="isDeleteUponUndeploy">true</property>
  </properties>
  
  </process-archive>

</process-application>
```

### Maven dependencies

The scope attributes of the dependency nodes are set to *provided* since the dependencies have to be loaded into the 
root classloader of the web container:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-engine-spring</artifactId>
  <version>${camunda.version}</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

The embedded tomcat server will be run with our pre-configured `server.xml`. This configuration file will be 
preprocessed so that variables with the name `${project.build.directory}` are being replaced with the proper path:

```xml
<Resource 
  name="jdbc/ProcessEngine"
  auth="Container"
  type="javax.sql.DataSource"
  factory="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory"
  uniqueResourceName="process-engine"
  driverClassName="org.h2.Driver"
  url="jdbc:h2:${project.build.directory}/camunda-h2-dbs/process-engine;MVCC=TRUE;TRACE_LEVEL_FILE=0;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE"
  username="sa"
  password="sa"
  maxPoolSize="20"
  minPoolSize="5" />
...
<Host name="localhost"  appBase="${project.build.directory}/to_deploy"
  unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">
```

The configuration files `server.xml` and `bpm-platform.xml` are being copied to the respective tomcat configuration path.

## How to use it?

1. Build it with Maven.

```bash
mvn clean verify
```

This will start the embedded tomcat server.

2. Watch out for this console log:

```bash
