/**
 * <p>This class transforms your regular java web application
 * into a "Process Application". A process application is
 * an application which interacts with the process engine,
 * provides BPMN deployment resources and delegate code.</p>
 *
 * <p>See also:
 * <a href="https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-applications/the-process-application-class">User Guide on the Servlet Process Application</a>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>From a technical perspective, this class is a
 * {@link ServletContextListener} which is auto-activated
 * using the {@link ProcessApplication} annotation. When the
 * application is deployed, it will scan the classpath for
 * process definition resources (files ending in *.bpmn) and
 * deploy them to the process engine.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is accompanied by a META-INF/processes.xml
 * deployment descriptor.</p>
