# Camunda Process Engine and Spring Boot


This example is not actively maintained anymore. You can refer to the example with fixed version of Camunda 7.18:
[README](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/blob/7.18/deployment/spring-boot/README.md).
Due to Camunda Platform 7 backward compatibility, the examples usually still work with later versions. However, you
might need to adjust them to make them work.

Or have a look at Camunda's implementation of the Spring Boot Starter: [spring-boot-starter/example-simple](/spring-boot-starter/example-simple).
