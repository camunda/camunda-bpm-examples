# EJB Process Application Example

This example is not actively maintained anymore. You can refer to the [example with fixed version of Camunda 7.22](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/tree/7.22/deployment/ejb-pa).
Due to Camunda Platform 7 backward compatibility, the examples usually still work with later versions. However, you might need to adjust them to make them work.

Or have a look at Jakarta EJB process application example: [deployment/ejb-pa-jakarta](/deployment/ejb-pa-jakarta).
