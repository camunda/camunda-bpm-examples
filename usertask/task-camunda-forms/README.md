# Overview

## Where are Camunda Forms added?

Camunda Forms can be added to the web resources of a web application. As we use maven, they are added to the [src/main/webapp][4] folder of your project.

## How are Camunda Forms referenced?

Camunda Forms are referenced using the `camunda:formKey` property of a BPMN `<startEvent>` or a BPMN `<userTask>`:

```xml
<startEvent id="startEvent" camunda:formKey="camunda-forms:app:start-form.form" name="Invoice Received">
  ...
</startEvent>
```

The attribute can also be set through the properties panel using the camunda Modeler:
