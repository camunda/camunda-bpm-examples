# Embedded Task Forms

This quickstart demonstrates how to use the [Embedded Forms][5] feature. Embedded Forms are plain HTML5 documents which can be loaded from your app and rendered embedded inside the camunda Tasklist:

# Overview

## Where are embedded taskforms added?

Embedded Forms can be added to the web resources of a web application. As we use maven, they are added to the [src/main/webapp][4] folder of your project.

## How are embedded taskforms referenced?

Embedded Taskforms are referenced using the `camunda:taskKey` property of a BPMN `<startEvent>` or a BPMN `<userTask>`:

```xml
<startEvent id="startEvent" camunda:formKey="embedded:app:start-form.html" name="Loan Request Received">
  ...
</startEvent>
```

The attribute can also be set through the properties panel using the camunda Modeler:
