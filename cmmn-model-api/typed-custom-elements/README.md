# Accessing custom CMMN extension elements in a strongly-typed way

This example is not actively maintained anymore. You can refer to the example with fixed version of Camunda 7.18:
[README](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/blob/7.18/cmmn-model-api/typed-custom-elements/README.md).
Due to Camunda Platform 7 backward compatibility, the examples usually still work with later versions. However, you
might need to adjust them to make them work.
